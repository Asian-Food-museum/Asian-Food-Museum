                <h3>3.1 Introduction</h3>
                <p>This chapter focuses on the research and design process behind the Asian Food Museum’s digital experience. Our goal is to create an engaging, user-friendly platform that allows visitors to explore and learn about Asian cuisine in an immersive
                    way. To achieve this, we conducted thorough research on user needs, designed an intuitive information structure, and developed an interactive navigation system. First, we present the user personas—representations of different visitor
                    types—helping us tailor the museum’s design to meet their expectations. Then, we outline the information architecture, detailing how content is structured and accessed throughout the website. These foundational elements guide the overall
                    design and usability of the digital museum, ensuring a seamless and enriching experience for all users.
                </p>
                <h3>3.2 User Personas</h3>
                <p>
                    To create a user-centered experience, we developed several personas that represent our target audience. These personas help us understand user needs, expectations, and behaviors, allowing us to design a more intuitive and engaging museum experience.
