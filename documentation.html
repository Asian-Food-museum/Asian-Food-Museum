                <h2>3. Research</h2>
                <h3>3.1 Introduction</h3>
                <p>This chapter focuses on the research and design process behind the Asian Food Museum’s digital experience. Our goal is to create an engaging, user-friendly platform that allows visitors to explore and learn about Asian cuisine in an immersive
                    way. To achieve this, we conducted thorough research on user needs, designed an intuitive information structure, and developed an interactive navigation system. First, we present the user personas—representations of different visitor
                    types—helping us tailor the museum’s design to meet their expectations. Then, we outline the information architecture, detailing how content is structured and accessed throughout the website. These foundational elements guide the overall
                    design and usability of the digital museum, ensuring a seamless and enriching experience for all users.
                </p>
                <h3>3.2 User Personas</h3>
                <p>
                    To create a user-centered experience, we developed several personas that represent our target audience. These personas help us understand user needs, expectations, and behaviors, allowing us to design a more intuitive and engaging museum experience.

                <h2>4. Design</h2>
                <h3>4.1 Color Scheme</h3>
                <p>The Food Museum follows a carefully chosen color scheme that aligns with both the food industry and the historical museum concept. Our design is built around three primary colors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Red (#772017)</li>
                    <li>Yellow (#EEE5C8)</li>
                    <li>Green (#9C9B84)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each color was chosen with a specific meaning in mind, ensuring that the visual identity of the website is both <b>engaging</b> and <b> historically relevant</b>.</p>
                <h4>4.1.1 Red (#772017) – The Essence of Appetite & Passion</h4>
                <p>
                    Red is one of the most powerful colors in the food industry because it is known to stimulate appetite and create a sense of excitement. This is why many restaurants and food brands incorporate red into their designs.
                    <br> In the Food Museum of Asia, our red is a deep, earthy shade (#772017) rather than a bright red. This darker tone reflects the historical and cultural depth of the foods displayed in the museum. It represents:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Spices</b> like chili, paprika, and saffron, which have shaped Asian cuisine.</li>
                    <li><b>Traditional cooking methods</b> like roasting, grilling, and slow-cooking, which bring out deep red hues in many dishes.</li>
                    <li><b>Warmth & passion</b> associated with food culture and communal dining.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This darker red tone also contributes to the museum's vintage aesthetic, making the experience feel more historical rather than overly commercial.</p>
                <h4>4.1.2 Yellow (#EEE5C8) – The Symbol of Nourishment & Tradition</h4>
                <p>
                    Yellow is commonly associated with happiness, warmth, and nourishment in the food industry. Many staple foods, such as rice, bread, and dairy, carry golden or yellow hues, making this color a universal symbol of food and sustenance.
                    <br> Our chosen shade of yellow (#EEE5C8) is a soft, muted tone that reflects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ancient grains & traditional foods</b> like wheat, rice, and flatbreads, which are fundamental to Asian diets.</li>
                    <li><b>Old parchment & manuscripts,</b> evoking the feeling of historical food records and recipes.</li>
                    <li><b>Balance & harmony,</b> a key element in Asian culinary traditions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Rather than using a bright, modern yellow, we opted for a muted yellow to match the museum’s antique feel, reinforcing the idea that the museum preserves the heritage of food throughout history.
                </p>
                <h4>4.1.3 Green (#9C9B84) – The Representation of Nature & Sustainability</h4>
                <p>
                    Green is a critical color in the food industry because it represents freshness, organic ingredients, and sustainability. It is often linked to natural foods, vegetables, and herbs that form the foundation of Asian cuisine.
                    <br> Our chosen green shade (#9C9B84) is a subdued, earthy green, symbolizing:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ancient agricultural practices</b> that shaped food traditions in Asia.</li>
                    <li><b>Herbs, tea, and natural ingredients</b> commonly used in traditional medicine and cooking.</li>
                    <li><b>The connection between food and nature,</b> emphasizing sustainability and organic eating.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By choosing a darker, muted green, the color blends with the historical ambiance of the museum, making it feel timeless rather than overly modern.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Dark Theme for a Historical & Vintage Aesthetic</h4>
                <p>
                    While many food-related designs use bright and vibrant colors, we intentionally darkened our primary colors to create a museum-like atmosphere. This was done to:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Align with the historical theme</b> – Since our museum is focused on food history, the color palette needed to reflect antiquity, tradition, and authenticity.</li>
                    <li><b>Create a vintage, old-world feel</b> – Muted and deep tones resemble aged paintings, old recipe books, and historical food artifacts, reinforcing the concept of a food museum.</li>
                    <li><b>Ensure a harmonious blend</b> – Darker shades of red, yellow, and green complement the website’s elegant typography, background textures, and historical imagery.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The result is a cohesive, warm, and immersive design that allows visitors to feel like they are stepping into a cultural archive of food history rather than just a modern website.

                <h3>4.2 Typography</h3>
                <h3>4.3 Layout and Components</h3>
                <h4>4.3.1 Landing Page</h4>
                <p>
                    The landing page serves as the welcoming gateway to the Food Museum of Asia, immersing visitors in the rich culinary history of the region. It features a hero section with a carefully chosen background image that visually represents the diversity and
                    vibrancy of Asian cuisine. This image sets the tone for the museum's purpose—showcasing the cultural and historical significance of food. At the center of this section, a welcome message introduces visitors to the museum, giving them
                    a brief insight into what they can explore. To encourage user engagement, a call-to-action button is prominently placed, inviting them to begin their journey through the museum’s exhibits.
                    <br> For ease of navigation, the landing page includes a menu button, designed with three horizontal white stripes, commonly known as a hamburger menu icon. This simple yet recognizable icon ensures that visitors can quickly access
                    different sections of the museum from any page. The use of a high-contrast white color for the menu button makes it highly visible against the background, improving usability. The overall design of the landing page focuses on clarity,
                    engagement, and a seamless introduction to the museum, ensuring that both first-time and returning visitors can easily navigate the site and enjoy its content.
                </p>
                <h4>4.3.2 Narrative Section</h4>
                <p>
                    The narrative section is a key component of the museum, organizing food items based on their geographical origins within Asia. This structure allows users to explore foods regionally, gaining insights into how geography has influenced cuisine, ingredients,
                    and culinary traditions. The section is designed with interactive buttons, each representing a different region, making navigation both intuitive and engaging. By clicking on these buttons, users can explore specific food items related
                    to that region, helping them discover the rich diversity of Asian cuisine. This approach not only provides historical knowledge but also makes the browsing experience more immersive and educational.
                    <br> A key focus in this section is responsive design, ensuring that it adapts smoothly to different screen sizes. On smaller screens, the buttons are arranged dynamically to maintain usability and readability, providing an optimal
                    experience for mobile users. Additionally, the spacing between button rows has been fine-tuned, with a maximum gap of 16 pixels to prevent excessive white space while maintaining a clean layout. This careful attention to spacing enhances
                    the visual organization of the page, ensuring that users can navigate comfortably without unnecessary scrolling. The balance between content, space, and responsiveness ensures that the narrative section remains visually appealing across
                    all devices.
                </p>
                <h4>4.3.2 Item Pages</h4>
                <p>
                    Each item page is structured to present detailed information about a specific food item, allowing visitors to delve into its historical and cultural significance. The top portion of the page prominently features the title and an image of the food, ensuring
                    that users can immediately recognize what they are exploring. Beneath the title, a short description provides an introductory overview, giving users a quick glimpse into the food’s significance before they choose to learn more. This
                    approach keeps the initial view simple and accessible, allowing visitors to engage with content at their own pace.
                    <br> To enhance interactivity, each page includes a "Tell Me More" button, which, when clicked, reveals a longer and more detailed description about the item. This feature ensures that users are not overwhelmed with too much text at
                    once but can access deeper insights when they wish. Additionally, navigation buttons ("Next" and "Previous") allow visitors to move seamlessly between different food items, making exploration fluid and intuitive. Importantly, when
                    users navigate to the next or previous item, the "Tell Me More" button resets, ensuring that each new page begins with only the short description visible. This design decision maintains consistency and a structured flow, enhancing
                    the browsing experience.
                </p>
                <h4>4.3.2 Interactive Elements</h4>
                <p>
                    Several interactive features have been implemented to ensure smooth and engaging user interactions across the museum’s website. One of these is the subcategory buttons, which allow visitors to filter food items efficiently. These buttons have been designed
                    with a responsive layout, ensuring that on smaller screens, they adjust dynamically to display two buttons per row. This arrangement optimizes space and prevents excessive scrolling, making the mobile experience just as seamless as
                    on larger screens. This flexibility ensures that users can quickly access different subcategories while maintaining a structured and aesthetically pleasing interface.
                    <br> In addition, a floating "Back to Top" button has been added to improve navigation, appearing only when users scroll down. Positioned at the bottom-right corner, this button allows users to instantly return to the top of the page,
                    reducing the need for excessive scrolling. To further enhance engagement, hover effects have been incorporated into buttons and interactive elements. These effects cause buttons to subtly change color when hovered over, providing visual
                    feedback that improves usability. These small but significant details contribute to a more immersive experience, ensuring that users can navigate and interact with the museum website effortlessly.
                </p>
                <h3>4.4 Images & Multimedia Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    This project offers an immersive digital experience showcasing the history and culture of Asian cuisine. The landing page features a hero section with a food-themed background image, a call-to-action button, and a hamburger menu for easy navigation. The
                    narrative section categorizes food items by geographical regions, with responsive buttons ensuring a smooth browsing experience. Each item page presents a dish with a title, an illustration, and a short description, alongside a “Tell
                    Me More” button that expands to reveal additional details. The images replicate the museum experience, where each dish is displayed on a table with its ingredients, just as visitors would see in a real exhibition. Navigation buttons
                    allow users to browse seamlessly, resetting descriptions for clarity. To enhance performance and usability, the website implements lazy loading, ensuring faster load times. Subcategory buttons are responsive, displaying two per row
                    on mobile screens. A floating "Back to Top" button simplifies navigation, while hover effects provide visual feedback. Handcrafted icons align with the museum’s theme, adding authenticity. The dark color palette was chosen to evoke
                    a historical ambiance, reinforcing the connection between food heritage and tradition. Through thoughtful design and functionality, the museum delivers an engaging and educational experience, making the rich culinary history of Asia
                    accessible to all.
