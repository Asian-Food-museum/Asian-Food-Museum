        Sooji ka Halwa is a staple dessert in Pakistani households, cherished not only for its delectable taste but also for its cultural and religious significance. The dessert is made by roasting semolina (sooji) in ghee until it turns golden brown and fragrant,
        then cooking it with sugar and water until it thickens into a soft, smooth halwa. Cardamom is added to enhance its flavor, and itâ€™s often garnished with slivers of almonds, pistachios, and sometimes raisins for added texture and taste. While the
        ingredients are simple, the careful balance of ghee, sugar, and semolina is what creates the dish's iconic richness and slightly grainy texture. Sooji ka Halwa is often prepared during religious ceremonies and festive events such as Eid or Milad
        celebrations.It is also made as a part of a sacred offering(nazar) during prayer gatherings and distributed to family and guests.It is typically paired with puris(fried flatbread) in a popular breakfast dish called Halwa Puri, often enjoyed on
        weekends or during festive breakfasts.The smooth, buttery texture of the halwa contrasts beautifully with the crispy puri, creating a harmonious blend of textures that is deeply satisfying.
