    <p>Chicken Biryani is a rich, layered rice dish that holds a central place in Pakistani cuisine. It is made by cooking marinated chicken with basmati rice and an intricate blend of spices, including cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and cumin. The chicken
        is often marinated with yogurt, garlic, and ginger, which not only tenderizes the meat but also infuses it with deep flavors. As the chicken cooks, its juices and spices mingle with the rice, creating a flavorful and aromatic experience that permeates
        the entire dish. Biryani is usually cooked in a “dum” style, where the pot is sealed with dough or a tight-fitting lid, allowing the steam to cook the ingredients to perfection. Chicken Biryani varies across regions in Pakistan, with each area
        offering its own unique take on the dish.Karachi - style biryani, for instance, is known for its intense heat and bold spices, while Lahore - style biryani may be slightly milder but equally fragrant.The dish is often garnished with fried onions,
        fresh coriander, mint, and sometimes boiled eggs or sliced potatoes.Chicken Biryani is usually accompanied by cooling sides like raita(a yogurt - based condiment) or kachumber salad(a tangy tomato, onion, and cucumber salad).The complexity of
        its flavors, from the richness of the chicken to the aromatic notes of the spices, makes it a favorite for both casual meals and special occasions in Pakistan.
