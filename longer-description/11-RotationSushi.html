    <p>Kaiten-zushi, also known as conveyor belt sushi, revolutionized the way sushi is served and enjoyed in Japan. The concept is simple: plates of sushi rotate around the restaurant on a conveyor belt, and customers pick what they want to eat directly
        from the belt. Each plate is color-coded to indicate its price, making it easy for diners to keep track of their meal costs. Traditional sushi varieties like maguro (tuna) and ebi (shrimp) are offered alongside more contemporary rolls that may
        include ingredients like avocado, mayonnaise, or tempura, reflecting the versatility of modern sushi. The allure of kaiten - zushi lies in its convenience and variety.Unlike traditional sushi dining, where each piece is made to order, the rotating
        conveyor belt allows for quick and easy selection of sushi dishes, making it perfect for busy or casual dining.Sushi chefs prepare the sushi in the center of the restaurant and place it on the conveyor belt, ensuring a continuous flow of fresh
        plates.Kaiten - zushi restaurants often provide a digital menu for custom orders, ensuring that customers can enjoy both freshly prepared items and whatever catches their eye from the belt.The communal, fast - paced nature of the experience, along
        with the wide range of options, has made kaiten - zushi a favorite among locals and tourists alike.
