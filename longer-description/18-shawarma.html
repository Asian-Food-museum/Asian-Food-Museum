        Shawarma is a culinary staple across the Middle East, and its unique preparation method gives it its distinctive flavor and texture. The meat used in shawarma is marinated for several hours in a combination of spices, herbs, and often yogurt or vinegar,
        which tenderizes the meat and enhances its flavor. Once marinated, the meat is layered on a large vertical spit, which slowly rotates in front of a heat source. As the meat roasts, the outer layer becomes crispy and caramelized, while the inside
        remains tender and juicy. The cooked meat is then shaved off in thin slices and served in a warm flatbread or pita wrap, typically accompanied by vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and cucumbers. What sets shawarma apart is its flexibility
        in both preparation and presentation.Depending on the region or personal preference, shawarma can be paired with a variety of condiments and sauces.In Levantine regions, garlic sauce, or toum, is a popular addition, providing a creamy, garlicky
        contrast to the savory meat.In some places, tahini or hummus may be added for extra richness, while in others, hot sauce or chili paste is used for a spicy kick.Shawarma is often served alongside French fries, pickled vegetables, or even rice,
        making it a versatile dish that can be adapted to individual tastes.Its widespread appeal lies not only in its bold, aromatic flavors but also in its convenience, making it one of the most popular street foods worldwide.
