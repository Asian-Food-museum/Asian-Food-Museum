    <p>Ash Reshteh is a quintessential Iranian dish that exemplifies the rich culinary heritage of Persian culture. It is made by simmering a variety of herbs such as parsley, cilantro, spinach, and dill, along with legumes like chickpeas, lentils, and kidney
        beans. These ingredients form the base of the soup, creating a nutrient-dense and flavorful broth. The addition of reshteh, a traditional type of Persian noodle, gives the soup its characteristic texture and heartiness. The noodles symbolize good
        fortune and prosperity in Persian culture, making Ash Reshteh a popular dish to serve during the New Year and other significant occasions. One of the most distinctive features of Ash Reshteh is its garnish.It is traditionally topped with crispy
        fried onions, dried mint, and kashk, a fermented dairy product that has a tangy and slightly salty flavor.The kashk adds depth and creaminess to the dish, balancing the earthy flavors of the herbs and legumes.Some variations of Ash Reshteh also
        include a drizzle of garlic - infused oil for an added layer of richness.The combination of textures— soft noodles, tender beans, and crispy garnishes— makes Ash Reshteh a filling and satisfying meal.Its thick consistency and bold flavors make
        it a comforting dish that is particularly popular during colder seasons.
