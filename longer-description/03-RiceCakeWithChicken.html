    Tahchin is a dish that combines artistry and flavor, standing out with its striking golden hue and its layers of marinated meat and aromatic rice. The dish starts with rice that is parboiled and mixed with yogurt, saffron, egg yolks, and oil. This mixture
    is then layered with tender, yogurt-marinated chicken or lamb, creating a rich, creamy texture inside. The dish is pressed into a pot and cooked slowly, allowing the outer layer of rice to become crispy and golden brown, forming the famous tahdig
    crust. This crunchy tahdig is one of the most cherished parts of the meal and is often what diners look forward to the most. What makes Tahchin truly unique is the balance of flavors and textures.The inside is soft and savory, with the yogurt and
    saffron blending beautifully with the chicken or lamb, while the outside has a delightful crunch from the crispy rice.The use of saffron, a quintessential ingredient in Persian cuisine, adds a deep, floral, and slightly sweet note to the rice, while
    barberries or dried fruits are sometimes sprinkled between the layers, offering bursts of tartness to complement the richness of the meat.Tahchin is typically served with a side of fresh herbs, yogurt, or pickles, balancing the richness of the dish
    with light, refreshing accompaniments.
