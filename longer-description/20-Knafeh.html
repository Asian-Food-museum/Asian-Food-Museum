        <em>Knafeh</em> is a unique dessert that holds a special place in the hearts of many across Lebanon and the wider Middle Eastern region. This decadent pastry is made with a base of <em>kataifi</em> (shredded filo dough) or semolina that is layered with a rich cheese filling, most commonly <em>akkawi</em> or <em>nabulsi</em> cheese, which are mild, salty cheeses that melt beautifully when heated. The dough and cheese are baked together until the top layer becomes golden and crispy, while the cheese inside becomes soft and gooey. Once the knafeh is out of the oven, it is drenched in a fragrant syrup made with sugar, water, and orange blossom or rose water, which adds a sweet, floral note to the dish. Knafeh's preparation varies slightly depending on the region. In Lebanon, it is traditionally made with semolina dough, giving it a more cake-like texture compared to the filo dough version popular in other Middle Eastern countries.It is often topped with a sprinkling of crushed pistachios for a nutty contrast to the sweet, cheesy filling. The dish is usually enjoyed warm, ensuring that the cheese remains stretchy and the syrup fully absorbed. It's a popular choice for breakfast, especially during weekends and holidays, but it is also served as a dessert after large meals, during Ramadan, or at celebratory events like weddings and family gatherings. Knafeh's indulgent sweetness and rich flavors make it a symbol of comfort and celebration in Lebanese culture.
