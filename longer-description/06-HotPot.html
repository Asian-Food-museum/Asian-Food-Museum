    <p>Hot pot, known as huǒguō (火锅) in Chinese, is more than just a meal—it’s a shared experience that brings people together around the table. The heart of the meal is the pot of boiling broth, which can range from spicy Sichuan-style with chili and peppercorns
        to lighter, clear broths made from chicken or pork bones. Diners choose from an array of raw ingredients such as thinly sliced beef, lamb, shrimp, mushrooms, leafy greens, and tofu, cooking them directly in the simmering broth. The fun lies in
        the interactive nature of the meal, as everyone dips their ingredients, waits for them to cook, and customizes each bite with different dipping sauces, such as sesame paste, soy sauce, garlic, and chili oil. The variety of ingredients and the
        broth’ s customization make hot pot adaptable to different tastes and dietary preferences, making it a favorite in Chinese homes and restaurants alike.Regional variations of hot pot abound across China: Sichuan hot pot is famed for its numbing
        heat from Sichuan peppercorns and dried chilies, while northern - style hot pot, commonly found in Beijing, tends to favor a mild broth made from lamb or beef.Other versions, such as seafood hot pot along China’ s coast, emphasize fresh ocean
        flavors.Hot pot 's ability to bring diverse ingredients together in one pot, while allowing each diner to tailor their own meal, reflects the diversity and communal spirit of Chinese food culture.
